# CS210

CS210 Term Project

The purpose of this project is to find a correlation between movie genres and ratings
from a dataset. For each genre, we have collected its corresponding movie rating and trained
our data for a machine learning model, as a conclusion we found that there is no correlation
between genre and rating.

Python is used in this project.
